\title{Median of a univariate functional dataset}
\usage{
median_fData(fData, type = "MBD", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fData}{the univariate functional dataset whose
median is required, in form of \code{fData} object.}

\item{type}{a string specifying the name of the function defining the depth
for univariate data to be used. It must be a valid name of a function defined
in the current environment, default is \code{MBD}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be used in the function specified by
argument \code{type}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{fData} object containing the desired
sample median.
}
\description{
This method computes the sample median of a univariate functional dataset
based on a definition of depth for univariate functional data.
}
\details{
Provided a definition of functional depth for univariate data,
the corresponding median (i.e. the deepest element of the sample) is returned as the desired median.
This method does \bold{not} coincide with the computation of the
cross-sectional median of the sample of the point-by-point measurements on
the grid. Hence, the sample median is a member of the dataset provided.

\examples{
N = 1e2
P = 1e2
grid = seq( 0, 1, length.out = P )

# Generating a gaussian functional sample with desired mean
# Being the distribution symmetric, the sample mean and median are coincident
target_median = sin( 2 * pi * grid )
C = exp_cov_function( grid, alpha = 0.2, beta = 0.2 )
fD = fData( grid, generate_gauss_fdata( N,
                                      centerline = target_median,
                                       Cov = C ) )

# Graphical representation of the mean
plot( fD )
plot( median_fData( fD ), col = 'black', lwd = 2, lty = 2, add = TRUE )
